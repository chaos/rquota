.SH NAME
quota \- display remote filesystem quota information
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B quota 
.I "[-v] [-r] [user]"
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B quota 
is a utility for displaying remote filesystem quota information.
This particular implentation does not report on local filesystem quotas
as it is intended to run in a computing center where all user data
resides on shared NFS servers.  In addition, quota only reports on 
filesystems listed in the
.I "quota.conf"
file to avoid lengthly query times in environments where there are many
NFS mounts, most of which are irrelevant to users logging in.
.LP
Quotas are reported in human-readable units: 'K', 'M', and 'T' bytes.

.SH OPTIONS
Run without arguments, quota only reports quota problems.
.LP
.I "-v"
Report on all filesystems, regardless of usage.
.LP
.I "-r"
Display the real filesystem paths rather than description from the
.I "quota.conf"
file.
.LP
.I "user"
[superuser only]  View the quota of another user.
