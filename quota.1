.TH QUOTA 1 "Release 1.0" "" "QUOTA"
.SH NAME
quota \- display remote filesystem quota information
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B quota 
.I "[-v] [-r] [-f configfile] [user]"
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B quota 
is a utility for displaying remote filesystem quota information.
This particular implementation does not report local filesystem quotas
as it is intended to run in a computing center where all user data
resides on shared NFS servers.  In addition, quota only reports
filesystems listed in the
.I "quota.conf"
file to reduce latency in environments where there are many remote filesystems
that are not configured with quotas.
.LP
Quotas are reported in human-readable units: 'K', 'M', and 'T' bytes.

.SH OPTIONS
Run without arguments, quota only reports quota problems.
.LP
.I "-v"
Report on all filesystems, regardless of usage.
.LP
.I "-r"
Display the real filesystem paths rather than descriptive versions from the
.I "quota.conf"
file.
.LP
.I "-f configfile"
loads a configuration file other than the default (see FILES below).
.LP
.I "user"
[superuser only]  View the quota of another user.
