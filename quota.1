.TH QUOTA 1 "Release 1.0" "" "QUOTA"
.SH NAME
quota \- display file system quota information
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B quota 
.I "[-v] [-l] [-t sec] [-r] [-f configfile] [user]"
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B quota 
displays file system usage and quota limits for ``user''.  
.LP
Quotas can be independently established for disk storage space
and number of files.
If a quota is not imposed, it will appear as ``n/a'' in \fIquota -v\fR output.
.LP
Hard quotas are enforced by the file system; for example, 
a \fIwrite(2)\fR which would exceed the hard disk usage quota will 
fail with ENOSPC.
.LP
Soft quotas are advisory for a configurable grace period, then are
enforced as hard quotas.  
.SH OPTIONS
Run without arguments, \fIquota\fR only reports quota violations.
It is intended to run in a login script to notify users when they
need to take action.  The following arguments are available:
.TP 
.I "-v"
Report on file systems even if quota limits are not exceeded.
.TP
.I "-l"
Report only the file system corresponding to the user's home directory.
.TP
.I "-t sec"
Set a timeout for all quota processing.
.TP
.I "-r"
Display real file system paths rather than descriptive versions from the
config file.
.TP
.I "-f configfile"
loads a configuration file other than the default (see FILES below).
.TP
.I "user"
View the quota of another user.
.SH "FILES"
/etc/quota.conf
.SH "CAVEATS"
Any user can query the NFS quota of another user.  
.LP
The ``percent'' field in the quota.conf(5) file is a kludge to provide a 
warning mechanism when a user exceeds a fixed percentage of the hard quota
for systems which may not implement soft quotas.
.LP
Group quotas are not supported.
