.TH QUOTA 1 "Release 1.0" "" "QUOTA"
.SH NAME
quota \- display remote filesystem quota information
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B quota 
.I "[-v] [-l] [-r] [-f configfile] [user]"
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B quota 
is a utility for displaying remote filesystem quota information.
This particular implementation does not report local filesystem quotas
as it is intended to run in a computing center where all user data
resides on shared NFS servers.  In addition, quota only reports
filesystems listed in the
.I "/etc/quota.conf"
file to reduce latency in environments where there are many remote filesystems,
not all of which should be queried for the quota report.
.LP
Quotas are reported in human-readable units: 'K', 'M', and 'T' bytes.

.SH OPTIONS
Run without arguments, quota only reports quota problems.
.LP
.I "-v"
Report on all filesystems, regardless of usage.
.LP
.I "-l"
Only report on the filesystem corresponding to the user's home directory.
.LP
.I "-r"
Display the real filesystem paths rather than descriptive versions from the
.I "/etc/quota.conf"
file.
.LP
.I "-f configfile"
loads a configuration file other than the default (see FILES below).
.LP
.I "user"
View the quota of another user.

.SH "FILES"
/etc/quota.conf

.SH "BUGS"
No special privilege is required to query the quota of another user.  
This is not the fault of the quota client; rather it is a limitation 
of the service.
.LP
Some NFS servers implement hard but not soft quotas.  The ``percent''
field in the quota.conf(5) file is a kludge to provide a warning mechanism
when a user exceeds a fixed percentage of the hard quota.
