.SH SYNOPSIS
.B quota 
.I "[-v] [-l] [-t sec] [-r] [-f configfile] [user]"
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B quota 
displays file system usage and quota limits for ``user''.  
.LP
Quotas can be independently established for disk storage space
and number of files.
If a quota is not imposed, it will appear as ``n/a'' in \fIquota -v\fR output.
.LP
Hard quotas are enforced by the file system; for example, 
a \fIwrite(2)\fR which would exceed the hard disk usage quota will 
fail with ENOSPC.
.LP
Soft quotas are advisory for a configurable grace period, then are
enforced as hard quotas.  
.SH OPTIONS
Run without arguments, \fIquota\fR only reports quota violations.
It is intended to run in a login script to notify users when they
need to take action.  The following arguments are available:
