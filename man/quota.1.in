.SH NAME
quota \- display file system quota information
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B quota
.I "[-v] [-l] [-t sec] [-r] [-f configfile] [user]"
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B quota
displays file system usage and quota limits for ``user''.
.LP
Quotas can be independently established for disk storage space
and number of files.
If a quota is not imposed, it will appear as ``n/a'' in \fIquota -v\fR output.
.LP
Hard quotas are enforced by the file system; for example,
a \fIwrite(2)\fR which would exceed the hard disk usage quota will
fail with ENOSPC.
.LP
Soft quotas are advisory for a configurable grace period, then are
enforced as hard quotas.
.SH OPTIONS
Run without arguments, \fIquota\fR only reports quota violations.
It is intended to run in a login script to notify users when they
need to take action.  The following arguments are available:
.TP
\fI-v\fR, \fI--verbose\fR
Report on file systems even if quota limits are not exceeded.
.TP
\fI-l\fR, \fI--login\fR
Report only the file system corresponding to the user's home directory.
.TP
\fI-t\fR, \fI--timeout\fR \fIseconds\fR
Set a timeout for all quota processing.
.TP
\fI-r\fR, \fI--realpath\fR
Display real file system paths rather than descriptive versions from the
config file.
.TP
\fI-f\fR, \fI--config\fR \fIconfigfile\fR
loads a configuration file other than the default (see FILES below).
A file name of \f-\fR indicates standard input.
.TP
\fI-N\fR, \fI--nfs-timeout\fR \fIseconds\fR
If a response to a single UDP NFS rquota RPC, including retries,
is not received within this timeout, the RPC is aborted with a timeout error
(default 2.5 seconds).
.TP
\fI-R\fR, \fI--nfs-retry-timeout\fR \fIseconds\fR
If a response to a single UDP NFS rquota RPC is not received within this
timeout, the request is retransmitted (default 0.5 seconds).
