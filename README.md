*rquota* provides drop-in replacements for quota and repquota utilities
on Linux and other UNIX-like operating systems.  Its configuration file
makes it possible to configure the file systems queried to only those
of interest, and to alias them for human readability in quota output.
Block counts are converted to human readable units.

*rquota* supports remote NFS and Lustre file systems.
At this time it does not support quotas on local file systems.
